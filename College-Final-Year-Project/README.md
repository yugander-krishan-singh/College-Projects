# Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms On Benchmark Medical Datasets

I did my final year project, together with two other peers, under the guidance of Dr. Jitendra Virmani(jitendravirmani@csio.res.in) at JUIT, Waknaghat.

## Objective
The objective of the project was to use the Machine Learning Algorithms on 3 diferent Medical datasets avaliable at UCI Machine Learning Repository. We trained and tested the Machine Learning Algorithms and reprsented the results using Confusion Matrices. In this project we used the following -

- Medical datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository:
  - [Pima Indian Diabetes](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes)
  - [Mammographic Masses](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)
  - [Statlog (Heart)](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29)

- Classifiers:
  - k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN)
  - Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN)
  - Support Vector Machine(SVM)
  - Smooth Support Vector Machine(SSVM)
