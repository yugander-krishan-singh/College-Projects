# Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms On Benchmark Medical Datasets

In this project we used Medical datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- [Pima Indian Diabetes](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes), 
- [Mammographic Masses](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)
- [Statlog (Heart)](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29)
